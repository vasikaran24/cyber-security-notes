<<<<< 🐧 Linux Operating System: Beginner-Friendly Guide >>>>>

{ A simple guide to help you understand what Linux is, why it matters, and how to start using it }

📌 What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system (OS) — like Windows or macOS — that manages your computer's hardware and lets you run programs.

But unlike Windows or macOS:

    Linux is open-source (you can see and modify the code)

    It’s free to use

    It’s used everywhere: in servers, phones (Android), IoT devices, and developer workstations

  🧠 Key Concepts
1. Kernel
   
The core part of Linux that talks to your hardware (like CPU, memory, storage). Every Linux system runs a kernel.
2. Distributions (Distros)

There are many versions of Linux, called distros. Each one bundles the Linux kernel with different tools and apps.

Popular distros:

    🐱 Ubuntu (great for beginners)

    🐧 Fedora

    🦄 Linux Mint

    🔒 Kali Linux (for cybersecurity)

    💻 Arch Linux (for advanced users)
