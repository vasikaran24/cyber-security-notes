üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity 101: A Beginner-Friendly Guide
================================================

What Is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, networks, and data from malicious attacks or unauthorized access
Whether you're a developer, student, or casual internet user, knowing basic cybersecurity keeps your work and identity safe.

==============
CORE CONCEPTS:
==============

1. THREATS 
-----------

Common types of digital threats include:

Malware   >>>> 	Malicious software like viruses, worms, or trojans
Phishing  >>>>  Deceptive emails or messages that trick you into revealing personal info
Ransomware >>>>	Locks your data until a ransom is paid
DDoS	   >>>>  Overwhelms a system to make it unavailable

2. Vulnerabilities
-------------------
Weak points in software, systems, or user behavior that attackers exploit.

Examples:
=========
    Using weak or reused passwords>>

    Running outdated software

    Clicking on suspicious links

3. Authentication & Authorization
-----------------------------------
    Authentication   ----- Verifying identity (e.g., login with username & password).
   
    Authorization    ------ Controlling access based on roles or permissions.

{Tip}: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to boost security.

5. Firewalls & Antivirus
-------------------------
    Firewall   -----  Filters network traffic and blocks suspicious activity.

    Antivirus  ----- Detects and removes known malware.

6. Social Engineering
----------------------
Humans are often the weakest link. Examples:

   1. Fake tech support calls

   2. ‚ÄúUrgent‚Äù emails from fake CEOs

   3.  USB drives left in public places

7. Data Breaches
-----------------

When attackers gain access to sensitive data, such as:

  1.  Email/password combos

  2.  Credit card info

  3.  Source code or intellectual property


=======================
üß† Good Cyber Hygiene
========================

Use strong, unique passwords
-  Enable MFA on all accounts
-  Keep your software up to date
-  Don‚Äôt click unknown links or attachments
